Hi :wave:! I am Sumanyu. I am a first year Masters student at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html) studying Computer Science. I am currently working with [Aishwarya Kamath](https://ashkamath.github.io/), [Nicolas Carion](https://www.nicolascarion.com/) and [Prof. Yann LeCun](http://yann.lecun.com/) on a Neuro-Symbolic Solver for Visual Question Answering. Previously, I was a Research Fellow at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I had the pleasure of working with Dr. [Chetan Arora](https://www.cse.iitd.ac.in/~chetan/), Dr. [Saket Anand](http://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) and Dr. [Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io/). I graduated with a Bachelors in Computer Engineering from [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in/) in 2020. My current research interests include multi-modal reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic AI e.t.c, however I also have prior background in algorithmic fairness, medical imaging, adversarial attacks and defenses.
