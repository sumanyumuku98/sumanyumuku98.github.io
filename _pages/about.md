Hi :wave:! I am Sumanyu. I am a ML Engineer working on Causal Inference and Discovery at [Causely](https://www.causely.io). Previously, I was working towards my Masters in CS degree at [NYU Courant](https://cs.nyu.edu/home/index.html). At NYU, I briefly worked in multi-modal reasoning, Neuro-Symbolic AI at the [CILVR Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/cilvr/). I also spent some time at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in/) where I dabbled in algorithmic fairness and medical imaging. Before IIT, I was studying for my Bachelors in Computer Engineering degree at [Delhi Technological University](http://www.dtu.ac.in/). If you have an interesting opportunity or a project idea to collaborate on, do reach out!
